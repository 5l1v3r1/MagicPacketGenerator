# MagicPacketGenerator
This script creates a little magic on the internet by pretending to portscan from random networks. 

It is currently broken, but easy to fix. I just need a few days to finish it for python3. It worked wonderfully when I tested it though. 

Requirements:
Scapy
Server able to spoof IPv4 IP addresses
A sense of humor
